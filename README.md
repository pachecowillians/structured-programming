# Structured programming
 These are the programs that i made in the functional-programming course. The main language used in the structured programming course is C. Here i used conditionals, loops, structs, worked with static and dynamic allocation of memory, pointers. I also learn to deal with open, write and read binary and text files in C.

 The main project of this course was the "SistemaDeAviacaoProgIIFinal" project, in the folder "Trabalho". This project was a system to sell airplane tickets. To store information, i used the file manipulation in C, storing and reading the information from the file. It worked like a database, but in the file. I also had to use dynamic allocation of memory to deal with the sell of tickets and store the information in the file. 
 
 In this project was necessary to manage the routes of the airplane and the stretches of each route. For solve that problem, was necessary to create a "relationship file" called "RotaTrecho" to store the stretches of each route and relate the route to the stretch.

  All the files was stored in binary files, and the ticked generated was stored in a text file for the client be able to read the information.

  The program also was made to run in Linux and Windows, and i set different colors to the terminal lines to make the interface more beautiful. These commands to change the color and clean the screen depends of the operational system, so i did two programs, one for Linux and the other for Windows, each one with the commands to run correctly in the operational system.
